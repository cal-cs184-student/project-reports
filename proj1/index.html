    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

    <p>
      For each middle point of the pixel we calculate three signed triangle areas created by the middle point and three
      points on the triangle. The formula for the signed area of a triangle can be derived from the cross product of two
      vectors.
      Suppose we have point A (ax, ay) and B (bx, by), then the signed area of the parallelogram they form is given by
      the magnitude of their cross product: |ax * by - ay * bx|.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
      <code>float L0 = -(x - x0) * (y1 - y0) + (y - y0) * (x1 - x0);</code> <br />
      <code>float L1 = -(x - x1) * (y2 - y1) + (y - y1) * (x2 - x1);</code> <br />
      <code>float L2 = -(x - x2) * (y0 - y2) + (y - y2) * (x0 - x2);</code> <br />
    </div>
    <p>
      In code above, the vectors A and B are formed by the edges of the main triangle and the lines connecting (x, y) to
      the opposite vertices The signed triangles is computed using the formula above, with negative values indicating
      the point (x, y) is outside the triangle and positive values indicating that it is inside the triangle. For a
      point lying on an edge of the triangle, we consider it as inside the triangle.
    </p>
    <h4>Algorithm Efficiency</h4>
    <p>
      To make sure our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle,
      we use the bounding box as shown below. Since we are exactly checking all the pixels within the tightest bounding
      box, the algorithm cannot be worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
      <code>float x_min = min(x0, min(x1, x2));</code> <br />
      <code>float x_max = max(x0, max(x1, x2));</code> <br />
      <code>float y_min = min(y0, min(y1, y2));</code> <br />
      <code>float y_max = max(y0, max(y1, y2));</code> <br />
    </div>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h3>

    <h4>Algorithm</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Iterate each pixel inside the bounding box.</li>
      <li>Iterate each sampling point inside the pixel</li>
      <li>
        If the sampling point is inside or on the edge of the triangle we append the corresponding color on that
        sampling point to the value col.
      </li>
      <li>Divide the col by the number of sampling points to get the average color.</li>
      <li>Set the pixel color to the average color.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Supersampling is useful for antialiasing because it can reduce the aliasing artifacts by sampling the color of
      multiple points within a pixel and taking the average of the colors. This can reduce the aliasing artifacts such
      as jaggies and staircases as shown in the figures below.
    </p>

    <div align="middle">

      <p>
        We changed the transform(0, -100) to transform(0, 0), so the head was removed. Pretty funny.

    <h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
    <p>
      Barycentric coordinates are a way to express a point inside a triangle as a weighted sum of the triangle's
      vertices. A point P inside the triangle ABC can be interpreted as
      <code>P = alpha * A + beta * B + gamma * C</code>, where <code>alpha + beta + gamma = 1</code>. This is useful for
      texture mapping because we can use the barycentric coordinates to determine the texture coordinates of a point P
      inside the triangle. We can then use the texture coordinates to sample the texture and get the color of the point
      P.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
      <code>
        float alpha = ((y1 - y2) * (x - x2) + (x2 - x1) * (y - y2)) / ((y1 - y2) * (x0 - x2) + (x2 - x1) * (y0 - y2));
      </code>
      <br />
      <code>
        float beta = ((y2 - y0) * (x - x2) + (x0 - x2) * (y - y2)) / ((y1 - y2) * (x0 - x2) + (x2 - x1) * (y0 - y2));
      </code>
      <br />
      <code>
        float gamma = 1 - alpha - beta;
      </code>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now we can use the barycentric coordinates to determine the texture coordinates of the point P. We can then color
      the point P using the texture coordinates.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
      <code>
        Color color = alpha * c0 + beta * c1 + gamma * c2;
      </code>
    </div>
    <div align="middle">

      <figcaption align="middle">Color Wheel</figcaption>
    </div>



    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
    <p>
      We can use the barycentric coordinates to determine the texture coordinates of the point P. We can then color the
      point P using the texture coordinates. Texture mapping is done by sampling the texture at certain points and using
      those samples to compute the color of the
      pixel.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Nearest neighbor sampling:</b> selects the color of the texture at the closest texture element to the
        sampled
        point.</li>
      <li><b>Bilinear sampling:</b> Tasks the average of the colors of the four closest texture elements to the sampled
        point.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <div align="middle">
      <img src="images/comparison_1_sample.jpg" align="middle" width="800px" alt="" />
      <figcaption align="middle">Sampling at 1 sample per pixel</figcaption>
    </div>
    <div align="middle">
      <img src="images/comparison_16_samples.jpg" align="middle" width="800px" alt="" />
      <figcaption align="middle">Sampling at 16 sample per pixel</figcaption>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Nearest:</b> This method can produce pixelated and jagged edges, as it simply selects the color of the
        closest texel to
        each pixel.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bilinear:</b> This produces a smoother image but it blurs the texture slightly when magnified too much as
        shown in
        sampling 1 per pixel, as the averaging the colors of the texels can cause the texture to lose its sharpness.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When the point is on the edge of an object (high frequency) area. For example
    <div align="middle">
      <br /><br />
      (0, 0, 0) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (255, 255, 255)
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      P
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
      (0, 0, 0) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (255, 255, 255)
      <br /><br />
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>Nearest: P = (0, 0, 0) or (255, 255, 255)</li>
      <li>Bilinear: P = (128, 128, 128)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
    <p>
      For shapes and objects that doesn't require full definition rendering on screen, such as distant objects in a
      3-dimensional scene, we can use Mipmap to save space. Using Mipmaps, we can use make the rendering more efficient
      and eliminate most of the artifacts caused by aliasing (when high frequencies are under sampled). In level
      sampling we
      first calculate which level of the texture mipmap we should use based on the differential elements that basically
      captures how much screen area a certain texture is using, and use the size (level) based on that. We then sample
      the
      texture at the level we calculated and use the color of the sampled point to color the pixel. This method produces
      a good quality image, as it samples the texture at multiple levels of the mipmap. This method is less expensive
      than pixel super sampling, as it requires less memory and less computation since the mipmap takes up a constant
      amount
      of memory. But for some textures, especially those with perspective that's not parallel to the screen, this method
      can be suboptimal when compared to pixel super sampling.
    </p>

    <h4> Describe the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three various
      techniques: pixel sampling, level sampling, or the number of samples per pixel.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Pixel sampling:</b> this method is the cheapest, as it requires the least memory and the least computation,
        looping through all the pixels and sampling once per pixel. But it produces a poor quality image, as it produces
        pixelated and jagged edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Level sampling:</b> This method produces a good quality image, as it samples the texture at multiple levels
        of the mipmap. This method is less expensive than pixel super sampling, as it requires less memory and less
        computation since the mipmap takes up a constant amount of memory. But for some textures, especially those with
        perspective that's not parallel to the screen, this method can be suboptimal when compared to pixel super
        sampling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Super sampling:</b> This method produces the best quality image, as it samples the texture at multiple points
        per pixel. This method is the most expensive, as it requires the most memory and the most computation, as it
        requires looping through all the pixels and sampling multiple times per pixel.
      </li>
    </ul>
